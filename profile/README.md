## Hi there 👋

We're Ericsson Intelligent Automation Platform (EIAP) - developer experience group.

We develop apps, tools and content to help the world write and develop their own network automation apps.

What is EIAP? It's Ericsson's product offering in Service Management & Orchestration (SMO) which is an [Open Radio Access Network](https://www.o-ran.org) (ORAN) standards aligned solution for everything you need to automate your network!

Our [developer portal](https://developer.intelligentautomationplatform.ericsson.net/) is in restricted early access - but we want to continually publish more in open source and want to welcome both your feedback and contributions!

Note: If you need help accessing the EIAP Ecosystem, contact support at this email address: intelligent.automation.platform@ericsson.com
